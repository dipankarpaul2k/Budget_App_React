# HomeBudget | React

It is a simple budgeting application where you can create a list of budgets. You can also add a list of expenses to an individual budget. You can view each budget individually, delete it or you can delete a specific expense of the budget. You can also see all the expenses in one page. 

I have used the browser local storage for this project and once logged out, all your data will be deleted.
